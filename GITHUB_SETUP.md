# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions

## What You Need to Do:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Sign up/Sign in
3. Click "New repository"
4. Name: `studyforexams-platform`
5. Description: `Smart Study Management Platform - PWA`
6. Make it **Public**
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Copy Your Repository URL
After creating, you'll see a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/studyforexams-platform.git
```
**Copy this URL!**

### 3. Run These Commands in Terminal
Replace `YOUR_REPO_URL` with the URL you copied:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - StudyForExams PWA"

# Connect to GitHub
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL

# Upload to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ That's It!

Your code will be on GitHub, but:
- ❌ **Nothing changes** on your current site
- ❌ **Netlify hosting** remains the same
- ❌ **No disruption** to existing functionality
- ✅ **Your code is now backed up** on GitHub
- ✅ **You can collaborate** with others
- ✅ **Version history** is preserved

## 🔄 Future Updates

When you want to update GitHub with new changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

## 🌐 Netlify Integration (Optional)

Later, you can connect Netlify to GitHub for automatic deployments:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect to your GitHub repo
4. Auto-deploy on every code change

**But for now, just focus on getting code to GitHub!**
